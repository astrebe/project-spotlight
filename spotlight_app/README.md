# spotlight_app

This app is a current work-in-progress and aims to tackle current issues with consumers being informed of
product recalls. Often times consumers don't always connect their contact info to purchases, or if they do, do not consistently look at information sent by these companies.

This app seeks to be a stop-gap for consumers who have regular purchase habits. Users will be asked to input their shopping habits, such as common purchase categories (furniture, baby, cleaning supplies, etc) as well as Brands they consistently buy from. Using this information Spotlight aims to shine a light on any products that have recent recalls that follow the user's filters. Users will then be notified every so often to check the filtered list for recalls that may affect them.

This app will ideally be a background app that will be opened for only a few minutes every couple of days. Should a user found they bought a product in the list, the next steps will inform them what to do next. This app is not a perfect solution, consumers should always be aware of what they are buying, but if they have Spotlight, they will have another tool in their toolkit to be a informed and safe buyer.
